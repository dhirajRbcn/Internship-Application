### [I2C Protocol Verification](https://github.com/dhirajRbcn/I2C-PROTOCOL.git)
- Designed an **I2C Slave RTL** in Verilog with FSM-based operations.  
- Verified using a **UVM-based environment** with both directed and randomized test cases.  

### [Dual-Port RAM â€“ Design & Verification](https://github.com/dhirajRbcn?tab=repositories)
- Designed a dual-port RAM supporting simultaneous read/write operations.  
- Verified via a transaction-level **SystemVerilog testbench** with layered components.  

### [Vending Machine Controller](https://github.com/dhirajRbcn/Vending-Machine-.git)
- FSM-based controller in Verilog for coin-based product dispensing.  
- Functionality verified through simulation.  

### [Traffic Light Controller](https://github.com/dhirajRbcn/Traffic-Controller.git)
- FSM-based traffic control system with pedestrian mode.  
- Simulated using **Icarus Verilog** to validate state transitions and timing.
